# Workspace Template

This is a sample workspace structure to help you get started with My Kanban.

## How to Use

1. Copy the contents of this folder to your selected workspace location
2. The app will automatically detect these pages
3. Modify, delete, or add new pages as needed

## Structure

```
workspace/
├── Getting Started/
│   └── index.md
├── Personal/
│   ├── index.md
│   ├── Daily Tasks/
│   │   └── index.md
│   └── Notes/
│       └── index.md
└── Work/
    ├── index.md
    └── Current Sprint/
        └── index.md
```

## Tips

- Each folder represents a page
- The `index.md` file contains the page content
- Folders can be nested infinitely (sub-pages)
- Use meaningful folder names (they become page titles by default)
- Edit the YAML frontmatter to customize metadata
